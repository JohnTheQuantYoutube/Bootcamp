Diastolic Blood Pressure is the blood pressure in between heart beats, usually the bottom number. \"Normal\" blood pressure is 120/80.

The general formula uses weight in kilograms over squared height in meters ($kg / m^2$). 19-24 is \"optimal\", 25-29 is considered \"over-weight\", 30 or higher is considered obese. There are levels of obesity as well but I don't think they're important here.\n","\n","6.

Higher numbers mean higher likelihood, supposedly.\n","\n","7. Age\n","  * Patient age, in years.\n","\n","8.
