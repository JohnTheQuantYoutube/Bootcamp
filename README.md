# Week 1

In Week 1, we're just starting to learn how to program in Python. The mini-project is short, simple, and doesn't require much math or complex programming.

# Mini-Project

In this week's mini-project, you're going to compare the average health factors for women with diabetes to the average health factors for women that don't have diabetes. 

You will also practice intepreting numbers, making graphs, and writing a research summary. It should be fun!

# Solution

This is what I did. It should not be identical to what you did. Your solution might look a lot simpler than mine, and that's okay! Remember, I've been doing this for years are you're just starting out. You'll be able to do this quick and easy yourself soon!

# BE CREATIVE! BE ADVENTUROUS! HAVE FUN!
